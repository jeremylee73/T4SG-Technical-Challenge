# T4SG-Technical-Challenge

My name is Jeremy Lee, and I'm a first year at Harvard College prospectively concentrating in Statistics with a secondary in Economics. This is my technical challenge for T4SG (Tech for Social Good), where I built a web app for the World Health Organization to track the distribution of vaccines.

# How to run locally

1. Ensure you have Flask and Flask-Session installed. If you have pip, simply type "pip3 install flask-session" and "pip install Flask" into your CLI to do so.
2. Clone this repository into your local machine.
3. In your CLI, navigate to the cloned directory and enter "python app.py"
4. Copy the returned IP address into your web browser. It should look something like "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"
5. Enjoy the web app!
