# T4SG-Technical-Challenge

My name is Jeremy Lee, and I'm a first year at Harvard College prospectively concentrating in Statistics with a secondary in Economics. This is my technical challenge for T4SG (Tech for Social Good), where I built a web app for the World Health Organization to track the distribution of vaccines.
